## VideoAnalyst 

VideoAnalyst is a web application that can help users to perform a multidimensional analysis for an uploaded video. Users can upload a personal pitch or a short speech, then VideoAnalyst would show a real-time sentiment analysis base on speaker's facial expression (by processing data from Microsoft Cognitive API). After finishing the sentiment data collection, VideoAnalyst would perform data analysis on all collected data, and it will help users to visualize data by showing various charts (by using chartjs and plotly.js). The final analysis outcomes include sentiment distribution, enthusiasm score, average age, and confidence score. In the next stage, we will collect data from more perspectives and perform more in-depth analyses (it will analyze the data in terms of both speech content and speaker's performance automatically).
